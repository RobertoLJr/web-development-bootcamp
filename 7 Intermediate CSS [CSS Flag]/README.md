# Section 7: Intermediate CSS [CSS Flag]

## Concept

This project introduces concepts regarding specificity and inheritance in the CSS file structure. It also introduces the possibility of combining CSS Selectors as well as CSS positioning with static, absolute, relative, and fixed values for the positioning property.

The code produces the flag of Laos by using the aforementioned topics. The text inside the flag acts as another layer of practice.
