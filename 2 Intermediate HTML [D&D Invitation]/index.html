  <p>"I am the ancient. I am the land. I am Count Strahd von Zarovich. Gaze upon me and tremble, foolish hunters. The walls of Castle Ravenloft are my domain, and here, I reign supreme. You wish to hunt me down? So be it. We are but four hours from planar midnight. I grant you four cosmic hours to explore the castle, uncover its mysteries, and confront me." Strahd turns over the hourglass and the sand begins to trickle into the bottom well. "But when the sands of time run out, so too will your lives. Welcome to Castle Ravenloft. Welcome... to your <i>doom!"</i></p>
