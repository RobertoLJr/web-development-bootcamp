# Section 9: CSS Flexbox [Guild Membership Table]

## Concept

This project was a fun experiment to play around with the CSS Flexbox positioning system. It represents a responsive static web page with 3 cards, each pertaining to a subscription tier to a guild from a medieval fantasy setting. This idea comes from the typical pricing tables found on many websites from businesses providing a myriad of services.
