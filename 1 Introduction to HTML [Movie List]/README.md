# Section 1: Introduction to HTML

## Concept

This project is the very same as the Python [Day 41 Project: Movie Ranking in HTML](https://github.com/RobertoLJr/100-days-of-python/tree/main/day-041-project-movie-ranking-in-html) from my Python studies repository and it acts as an introduction to web development with HTML5. It works with only heading and paragraph elements, including void, such as `<br>` and `<hr>`.

The two files apart from the `index.html` contain examples of the aforementioned elements while the former makes use of those to build a simple HTML web page.

The page contains a Movie Ranking with 3 of my favourite movies of all time.
