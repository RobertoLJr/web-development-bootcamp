<h1>The Best Movies According to Roberto</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
<p>Thoughtful. Introspective. Dystopic. This is a neo-noir exploration of solitude and the pursuit of meaning in one's life. It also contains philosophical questions about how humanity views and interact with AIs.</p>

<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>Bittersweet. Emotional. Touching. This is a creative and powerful take on romance and its tropes. Surrealism acts as the cherry on the cake.</p>

<h3>The Seventh Seal</h3>
<p>Bold. Poetic. Grim. This film can be a deeply personal experience for some. It proves that the best religious movies might yet be the godless ones.</p>
