# Section 5: Introduction to CSS [Colour Vocab Website]

## Concept

This project introduces [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) to stylize web pages.

The web page presents some boxes colourised and the respective name of each colour right above them. The HTML is as simple as possible with the style sheet applied externally, changing font colours, image sizes, and text alignment.
