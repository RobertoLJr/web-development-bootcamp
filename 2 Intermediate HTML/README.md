# Section 2: Intermediate HTML

## Concept

This simple project demonstrates the use of HTML list elements, nesting and indentation, anchor elements, and image elements, all combined in a static web page.

The page acts as an invitation for a one-night session for the [Dungeons and Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/pt-BR) roleplaying tabletop game.
