# Section 3: Multi-Page Websites

## Concept

Simple project demonstrating how to navigate between static pages via relative paths. It also contains a basic file structure for more complex applications that should look more organized than previous projects.

The home page contains links and images for the previous two projects and two links that redirect to the About and Contact Me pages.
