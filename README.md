# Web Development Bootcamp

This repository was created to compile studies, projects, and resources related to web development. It should be used for quick reviews and access to documentation of specific topics, hence the structure of the directories. Portfolio projects and/or more advanced and complex projects will have their respective repositories.

Each section represents a directory containing code files and assets as well as a README file with references and notes.
