# Section 6: CSS Properties [Meme Poster Website]

## Concept

This project introduces more CSS properties, such as fonts, and the concept of the box model. It makes use of the margin, padding, and border properties for simple positioning of elements along with the introduction of the `<div>` HTML tag for ease of positioning.

The application is a static web page that simulates a traditional internet meme format - an image with a title and a paragraph, centralised.
